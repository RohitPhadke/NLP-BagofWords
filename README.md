# NLP-BagofWords
A Natural Language Processing technique of text modeling known as Bag of Words model. Whenever we apply any algorithm in NLP, it works on numbers. We cannot directly feed our text into that algorithm. Hence, Bag of Words model is used to preprocess the text by converting it into a bag of words, which keeps a count of the total occurrences of most frequently used words.This model can be visualized using a table, which contains the count of words corresponding to the word itself.  
We use two different techniques for text pre-processing before converting a BagofWords model.  
 1. Lemmatization
 2. Stemming  
Various observations after implementing stemming and lemmatization and their possible applications are also discussed.
